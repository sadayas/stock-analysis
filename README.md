# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The client, Steve, wants to know how the entire stock mark was over the last few years.  With his research and data he collected for his parents, we are able to analyze and develop code to read through the data.

## Results

In our results, we are able to see that the return between 2017 is much higher than 2018. With nearly all the stocks having a positive return.  However in 2018, as shown in the images, the stocks took a negative return.  The tickers ENPH and RUN, however saw its return raise exponentially.

With the refractored script, we were able to process the data quicker.  It took away seconds compared to the original code.
